                    <h3>IPL 2025 Kicks Off with Star-Studded Inaugural Ceremony</h3>
                    <p>
                        The 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season officially begins on March 22, with a grand opening
                        ceremony featuring Bollywood stars and live performances. This year’s tournament promises
                        high-octane action and fierce competition. Chennai Super Kings (CSK), with their strong lineup
                        and the leadership of MS Dhoni, are among the top contenders to claim the title. Dhoni’s
                        strategic brilliance and experience give CSK a significant edge in their pursuit of a sixth IPL
                        championship. Alongside CSK, Mumbai Indians (MI) are also strong favorites, with a deep squad
                        and excellent form heading into the season.
