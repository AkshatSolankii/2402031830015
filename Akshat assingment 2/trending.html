                    <h3>India Triumphs Over New Zealand to Secure 2025 Champions Trophy</h3>
                    <p>
                        In a thrilling final at Dubai International Cricket Stadium, India clinched the 2025 ICC
                        Champions Trophy by defeating New Zealand by four wickets. Batting first, New Zealand posted a
                        total of 251 runs, with significant contributions from Michael Bracewell (53 not out) and Daryl
                        Mitchell (63). India's bowlers, led by spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy, played
                        pivotal roles in restricting New Zealand's scoring. Chasing the target, Indian captain Rohit
                        Sharma top-scored with a resilient 76 runs. Despite a late surge from New Zealand's spinners,
                        India achieved the target with nine balls to spare, finishing the tournament unbeaten.
